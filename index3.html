                <h2>Prime Minister Of India</h2>
                <p> Narendra Modi (born September 17, 1950, Vadnagar, India) is an Indian politician and government official who rose to become a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
                     In 2014 he led his party to victory in elections to the Lok Sabha (lower chamber of the Indian parliament), after which he was sworn in as prime minister of India. 
                     Prior to that he had served (2001–14) as chief minister (head of government) of Gujarat state in western India. 
                     The Modi-led BJP (and the BJP-led NDA alliance) won majority again in the 2019 general election. 
                     Although the BJP failed to secure a majority on its own in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP-led NDA alliance won 293 of the 543 seats in the Lok Sabha, paving the way for Narendra Modi to become the country’s prime minister for a third consecutive term.
                     <h2>About His Early Life</h2></p>
                     <p>
                    Modi was raised in a small town in northern Gujarat, and he completed an M.A. degree in political science from Gujarat University in Ahmadabad.
                    He joined the pro-Hindu Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) organization in the early 1970s and set up a unit of the RSS’s students’ wing, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, in his area.
                    Modi rose steadily in the RSS hierarchy, and his association with the organization significantly benefited his subsequent political career.

                    Modi joined the BJP in 1987, and a year later he was made the general secretary of the Gujarat branch of the party. 
                    He was instrumental in greatly strengthening the party’s presence in the state in succeeding years.
                     In 1990 Modi was one of the BJP members who participated in a coalition government in the state, and he helped the BJP achieve success in the 1995 state legislative assembly elections that in March allowed the party to form the first-ever BJP-controlled government in India. 
                    The BJP’s control of the state government was relatively short-lived, however, ending in September 1996.</p></section>
